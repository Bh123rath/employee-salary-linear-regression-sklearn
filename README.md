I worked on a Salary Prediction Project using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and Jupyter Notebook.
The goal was to predict employee salaries based on their years of experience using the Simple Linear Regression algorithm.

📊 Dataset Snapshot:

Sid	Name	Experience (Years)	Salary
1001	Kiran Rao	1	25,000
1002	Ravi Verma	2	50,000
1003	Shreya Menon	3	75,000
1005	Manoj Verma	5	1,25,000

🔮 Prediction Example:
For an employee with 4 years of experience, the model predicts a salary of approximately ₹1,00,000.

🛠 Key Tools & Libraries Used:

Pandas → Data cleaning & preprocessing

Matplotlib → Data visualization (scatter plots & regression line)

Scikit-Learn → Implementing Simple Linear Regression

Jupyter Notebook → Interactive environment for coding & visualization

✨ This project demonstrates how Machine Learning algorithms can provide accurate insights and predictions using minimal features.📊 Project Overview

Objective: Predict salary of employees based on years of experience.

Dataset: A structured dataset containing columns like Experience and Salary.

Approach:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing with Pandas

Data Visualization with Matplotlib

Model Building using Linear Regression (Scikit-Learn)

Salary Prediction for unseen values

🛠️ Tech Stack
